<mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>One common method used to improve the resilience of digital environments is the use of back-up systems.</mark> Back-up systems <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>involve creating and storing copies of data and systems, so that they can be used to restore the digital environment in the event of a disruption,</mark> such as a hardware failure or security breach.</p></li><li><p><strong>hot, cold and warm sites</strong></p><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>There are several ways that organizations can implement back-up systems</mark>, including the following:</p><ol><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>On-site backups</mark>: Organizations can implement on-site back-up systems, which involve creating and storing copies of data and systems on local storage devices, such as hard drives or tape drives. These back-up systems can be used to quickly restore data and systems in the event of a disruption, without the need to transfer data over a network.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Off-site backups:</mark> Organizations can also implement off-site back-up systems, which involve creating and storing copies of data and systems at a remote location. This can include using cloud-based storage services, or using remote servers or storage devices. Off-site back-up systems can provide additional protection against disruptions, such as natural disasters or power outages, which may affect both the primary and on-site back-up systems.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Automated backups:</mark> Organizations can implement automated back-up systems, which automatically create and store copies of data and systems on a regular basis. This can include setting up schedules for creating and storing back-ups, as well as configuring the back-up system to automatically update and maintain the back-up copies.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>data back-up and recovery procedures</strong>
<mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>One common method used to improve the resilience of digital environments is the implementation of data back-up and recovery procedures.</mark> Data back-up and recovery procedures<mark style=background:#fff3a3a6> involve regularly creating and storing copies of data, as well as developing and testing plans for restoring data in the event of a disruption or disaster.</mark></p><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>To implement effective data back-up and recovery procedures, organizations can follow the following steps</mark>:</p><ol><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Identify critical data:</mark> Organizations should first identify the data that is critical to the operation and success of the organization. This may include data such as customer records, financial records, or operational data.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Create back-up copies:</mark> Organizations should then create back-up copies of the identified critical data, and store these copies in a secure location. This may include using on-site or off-site back-up systems, or using cloud-based storage services.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Develop recovery plans:</mark> Organizations should develop and test plans for restoring the critical data in the event of a disruption or disaster. These plans should specify the steps and resources that will be needed to restore the data, and should be tested regularly to ensure their effectiveness.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Monitor and maintain</mark>: Organizations should monitor the back-up and recovery systems regularly, to ensure that the back-up copies are up-to-date and that the recovery plans are effective. Organizations should also maintain the back-up and recovery systems, to ensure that they remain operational and can be used to restore data in the event of a disruption.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>data back-up and recovery procedures are an essential part of ensuring the resilience of digital environments</mark>. By regularly creating and storing back-up copies of critical data, and by developing and testing recovery plans, <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>organizations can reduce the risk of data loss and downtime, and can maintain the availability and integrity of their digital environments.</mark></p></li><li><p><strong>device hardening</strong>
-One common method used<mark style=background:#fff3a3a6> to improve the resilience of digital environments is device hardening</mark>. Device hardening <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>involves implementing security controls and configurations on individual devices, such as computers, servers, and routers, to reduce the risk of security breaches and other disruptions.</mark></p><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>To implement effective device hardening, organizations can follow the following steps:</mark></p><ol><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Identify devices</mark>: Organizations should first identify the devices that are critical to the operation and security of the digital environment. This may include devices such as servers, routers, firewalls, and end-user computers.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Implement security controls</mark>: Organizations should then implement security controls on the identified devices, such as passwords, access controls, and firewalls, to prevent unauthorized access and protect against security threats.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Monitor and update:</mark> Organizations should monitor the devices regularly, to ensure that the security controls are effective and that the devices are operating properly. Organizations should also update the security controls and configurations on the devices, to ensure that they remain effective and to protect against new security threats.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Test and verify:</mark> Organizations should test and verify the effectiveness of the security controls and configurations on the devices, to ensure that they are providing adequate protection. This may include conducting penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, and other security tests.</p></li></ol><p>Overall,<mark style=background:#fff3a3a6> device hardening is an effective method for improving the resilience of digital environments</mark>.
