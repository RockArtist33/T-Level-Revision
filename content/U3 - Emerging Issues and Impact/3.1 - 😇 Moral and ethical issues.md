##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">3.1.1 - Understand the ethical and moral issues that an increasing reliance on technology raises, and how organisations and individuals can respond to these challenges
</mark>

One way that organizations and individuals can respond to these challenges is by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">implementing policies and practices that promote responsible use of technology and digital services.</mark> This can include <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">establishing clear guidelines for acceptable use of technology,</mark> ensuring that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">employees understand and follow these guidelines, and regularly monitoring compliance</mark>. In addition, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">organizations can work to promote diversity, inclusion, and equality in their use of technology and digital services,</mark> and can also <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">take steps to reduce their environmental impact through the use of sustainable technology and practices.</mark>

Another important response to these challenges is to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">stay informed and educated about the latest developments in technology and its impact on society</mark>. This can include <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">staying up-to-date on the latest trends and innovations in the field</mark>, as well as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">keeping an eye on changes in societal norms and the behavior of individuals</mark>. By <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">staying informed and proactive, organizations and individuals can be better prepared to respond to the challenges posed by technology and the digital world.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Additionally, organizations can work to promote open source and Creative Commons practices</mark>, which can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">help to increase access to technology and digital services for all individuals, regardless of their economic or social circumstances</mark>. By fostering a culture of collaboration and sharing, organizations <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can help to reduce the inequalities that can arise in the use of technology and digital services.</mark>

Overall, responding to these challenges requires a combination of proactive policies and practices, as well as a commitment to staying informed and educated about the latest developments in technology and its impact on society. By taking these steps, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">organizations and individuals can help to ensure that technology and digital services are used in a responsible and equitable way.</mark>

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">3.1.2 - Understand how organisations and individuals respond to ethical and moral issues when designing and developing digital systems</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">When designing and developing digital systems, organizations and individuals can respond to ethical and moral issues in a number of ways</mark>, including by using guidelines from professional organizations, engaging in strategic planning and decision-making, developing and implementing internal policy documents, establishing and maintaining a positive company culture, and encouraging whistleblowing.

- **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">use of guidelines from professional organizations</mark>**
	- Using guidelines from professional organizations can help organizations and individuals ensure that their technology is designed and developed in an ethical and responsible manner. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">These guidelines can provide guidance on best practices and standards for ethical conduct, and can help organizations and individuals avoid common pitfalls and potential ethical dilemmas.</mark>
- **<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">strategic planning and decisions</mark>**
	- Strategic planning and decision-making can also help organizations and individuals respond to ethical and moral issues when designing and developing digital systems. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">By engaging in thoughtful and deliberate planning, organizations can identify potential ethical issues and take steps to prevent or mitigate them. This may involve setting clear goals and objectives, conducting risk assessments, and implementing safeguards to protect against potential negative consequences of the technology.</mark>
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the content of internal policy documents</mark>**
	- Internal policy documents can also play a crucial role in helping organizations and individuals respond to ethical and moral issues. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">These documents can outline the organization's values and ethical standards, and can provide guidance on how employees should conduct themselves when designing and developing digital systems.</mark> By clearly communicating these policies to employees, organizations can help ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to ethical conduct.
- **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">company culture and how this is established, communicated and sustained</mark>**
	- Company culture is another important factor in how organizations and individuals respond to ethical and moral issues. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">A positive company culture that values ethics and responsibility can help foster a sense of accountability and responsibility among employees, and can encourage employees to act in an ethical manner when designing and developing digital systems. This culture can be established through clear communication of the organization's values, by providing ethics training and support to employees, and by promoting a culture of transparency and open communication.</mark>
- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">whistleblowing</mark>**
	- Finally, encouraging whistleblowing can also be an effective way for organizations and individuals to respond to ethical and moral issues. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">By creating a safe and supportive environment for employees to raise concerns, organizations can help ensure that any ethical concerns are quickly identified and addressed. This can help prevent potential ethical breaches and can foster a culture of accountability and responsibility.</mark>



##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">3.1.3 - Understand how individuals use a range of observational techniques to inform situational awareness</mark>

Individuals can use observational techniques to inform their situational awareness by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">paying attention to normal behavior</mark>, being aware of their co-workers, and recognizing changing or abnormal behavior. By observing normal behavior, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">individuals can gain a better understanding of what is typical in a given situation, which can help them identify when something is out of the ordinary.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Being aware of co-workers can also be important for situational awareness.</mark> By paying attention to what other people are doing, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">individuals can gain valuable information about the situation and can identify potential hazards or changes in the environment.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Recognizing changing or abnormal behavior is another key component of situational awareness.</mark> By paying attention to changes in behavior, individuals can identify potential problems or hazards, and can take appropriate action to prevent or mitigate any potential negative consequences. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">This may involve communicating with others, adjusting their own behavior, or taking other actions to ensure safety and security.</mark>
