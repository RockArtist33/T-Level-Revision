##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">1.1.1 - Be able to use top-down, bottom-up and modularisation approaches to solve problems.</mark>

The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">top-down approach to problem-solving involves breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller and more manageable subproblems.</mark> This approach allows you to focus on one aspect of the problem at a time, making it easier to find a solution.

The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">bottom-up approach, on the other hand, involves starting with the individual components of a problem and then working up to more complex solutions.</mark> This approach is useful when you have a good understanding of the individual parts of a problem but need to figure out how they fit together to form a complete solution.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Modularisation, also known as modular design, is a design approach that involves dividing a system into separate, independent modules that can be developed and tested independently.</mark> This approach can help to make a system more flexible and adaptable, as well as easier to maintain and update.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">To use these approaches effectively, you will need to carefully consider the specific problem you are trying to solve and determine which approach is best suited to finding a solution.</mark> In some cases, it <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">may be necessary to use a combination of these approaches in order to effectively solve a complex problem.</mark>


#####  <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">1.1.2 - Be able to decompose problems </mark>

- **identifying and describing the main features of a problem or process**
	- To identify the main features of a problem or process, you will need to carefully <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">analyze the situation and consider what is happening, why it is happening, and how it is happening</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">This will typically involve looking at the inputs, outputs, and processes involved in the problem</mark> or process, as well as the potential causes and effects.
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Once you have identified the main features of a problem or process, you can describe them by providing a clear and concise explanation of what they are and how they are relevant to the situation. </mark>This may involve using specific terminology or technical language to accurately convey the key features of the problem or process.
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The main features of a problem or process are the key characteristics or elements that define it. </mark>These may include the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inputs, outputs, processes, causes, and effects that are involved in the problem or process.</mark>
- **breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts**
	- To  break a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts, you can use a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">technique </mark>called <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">decomposition</mark>. This <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">involves dividing the problem into smaller, simpler subproblems that can be solved independently.</mark> This can make it <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">easier to find a solution</mark> to the overall problem, as it allows you to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">focus on one aspect of the problem at a time.</mark>
	- Here are some <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">steps you can follow to break a problem down into smaller parts using decomposition:</mark>
	
	1.  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Identify the main problem</mark> or challenge that you are facing. This will be the overall goal that you are trying to achieve or the problem that you are trying to solve.
	    
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> Break the main problem down into smaller, more manageable subproblems</mark>. This might involve identifying specific components or aspects of the problem that you can focus on individually.
	    
	3.  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Prioritize the subproblems based on their importance or urgency</mark>. This will help you to focus on the most important or pressing issues first.
	    
	4.  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Develop a plan or strategy for solving each subproblem. This might involve identifying the steps or actions that you need to take in order to solve the subproblem</mark>, as well as the resources or tools that you will need.
	    
	5. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> Implement your plan and work on solving each subproblem individually. As you solve each subproblem, you will be making progress towards solving the overall problem.</mark>
	    
	
	-  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">By breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts, you can make it easier to find a solution and make progress towards achieving your goal.</mark> This approach can be useful for a wide range of problems and challenges, from simple tasks to complex, multi-faceted challenges.


##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">1.1.3 - Be able to use pattern recognition to:</mark>
-  **identify and describe trends and similarities within and between problems and processes**
	- To identify and describe trends and similarities within and between problems and processes, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">you will need to carefully analyze the data or information available to you. This may involve looking at patterns, trends, or regularities in the data, as well as comparing different problems or processes to identify commonalities or similarities.</mark>

	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Once you have identified trends or similarities, you can describe them by providing a clear and concise explanation of what they are and how they are relevant to the situation.</mark> This may involve using specific terminology or technical language to accurately convey the key features of the trends or similarities.

	- Here are some examples of how you might identify and describe trends and similarities within and between problems and processes:

	-   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Within a problem: You are trying to diagnose a problem with your car's engine.</mark> You notice that the engine is making a loud knocking noise when you start it up, and that this noise gets louder as the engine warms up. You also notice that the noise is more pronounced when the car is under load (e.g. when driving up a hill) and that it goes away when the engine is cold.
    
	-   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Trend: The knocking noise gets louder as the engine warms up</mark> and is more pronounced when the car is under load.
    
	-   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Description: The trend in this problem is that the knocking noise gets louder</mark> as the engine warms up and is more pronounced when the car is under load. This suggests that the problem is related to the engine's performance when it is operating at high temperatures or under heavy loads.
    
	-   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Between problems: You are trying to diagnose two different problems with your car.</mark> The first problem is that the engine won't start, and the second problem is that the headlights won't turn on. You notice that both problems occurred after the car was parked in a flooded parking lot.
    
	-   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Similarity: Both problems occurred after the car was parked in a flooded parking lot.</mark>
