##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.2.3 - Understand the features, characteristics, benefits and drawbacks of wired connection methods</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Wired connection methods refer to the use of physical cables to establish a connection between devices.</mark> Some common wired connection methods include Ethernet, USB, and HDMI.

<mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">PROS</mark> / <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">CONS</mark>

<mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">One of the main advantages of wired connections is their stability and reliability.</mark> Because the devices are physically connected, there is less interference and a more consistent flow of data. This can be especially important for applications that require a high-speed or high-bandwidth connection, such as gaming or streaming video.

<mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Another advantage of wired connections is that they generally offer faster speeds than wireless connections.</mark> This is because wired connections can provide a dedicated connection for each device, whereas wireless connections must share bandwidth among multiple devices.

<mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">In addition, wired connections are often more secure than wireless connections</mark>. Because the devices are physically connected, it is much more difficult for an unauthorized user to access the network. This can be especially important for applications that involve sensitive data, such as online banking or shopping.

However, there are also some drawbacks to using wired connections. <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">One of the main disadvantages is that they can be inflexible and difficult to install.</mark> In order to establish a wired connection, the devices must be physically connected with a cable. This can be inconvenient, especially in cases where the devices are not located near each other or if the cables are not long enough to reach.

<mark style="background: #D71414A6;">Another disadvantage of wired connections is that they can be messy and unsightly.</mark> Depending on the number of devices and the layout of the space, a wired connection can involve a tangle of cables that can be difficult to manage and can detract from the appearance of the space.

<mark style="background: #D71414A6;">Overall, the decision to use wired connections will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the situation.</mark> While they offer some benefits, such as stability and security, they also have some drawbacks, such as inflexibility and a cluttered appearance.




##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.2.4 - Understand different types of network</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">LAN, WAN, and PAN</mark> are different types of computer networks that are used for different purposes and have different characteristics.

A <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">LAN</mark> (Local Area Network) is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">network that is used to connect devices that are located within a relatively small geographic area, such as a single building or campus.</mark> LANs are often used to connect computers and other devices within an organization, such as a business or school.

A <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">WAN</mark> (Wide Area Network) is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">network that is used to connect devices that are located over a large geographic area, such as across multiple buildings or even across different cities or countries. </mark>WANs are often used to connect multiple LANs together, allowing them to share resources and communicate with each other.

A <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">PAN</mark> (Personal Area Network) is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">network that is used to connect devices that are located within a relatively small area, such as within a single room or within a person's immediate proximity.</mark> PANs are often used to connect personal devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

In general, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">LANs are used for local communication and resource sharing, WANs are used for long-distance communication, and PANs are used for personal communication and device connectivity.</mark>



##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.2.5 - Understand the concepts of bandwidth and latency, and their effect on the performance of networks and connected systems</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Bandwidth and latency are two important factors that can affect the performance of networks and connected systems.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Bandwidth</mark> refers to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the amount of data that can be transferred over a network in a given amount of time. It is typically measured in bits per second (bps) or megabits per second (mbps). High-bandwidth networks can transfer more data in a given amount of time</mark>, which can improve the performance of applications that require a lot of data to be transferred, such as streaming video or online gaming.

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Latency</mark>, on the other hand, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">refers to the time it takes for data to be transferred from one device to another over a network. It is typically measured in milliseconds (ms). Low-latency networks have a shorter delay</mark>, which can improve the performance of applications that require quick responses, such as voice or video calls.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Both bandwidth and latency are important for the performance of networks and connected systems.</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">High-bandwidth networks can support the transfer of large amounts of data</mark>, while <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">low-latency networks can support real-time communication and quick response times.</mark> However, it is also<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> important to note that increasing one of these factors can sometimes have a negative effect on the other</mark>. For example, increasing the bandwidth of a network can sometimes increase its latency, and vice versa.



##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.2.6 - Understand the concept of different network models</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">There are several different network models that are used to classify and organize networks based on their characteristics and features</mark>. Some of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">most common network models include the client-server model, the peer-to-peer model, and the hybrid model.</mark>

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The client-server model</mark> is a type of <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">network in which certain devices, called servers, provide services to other devices, called clients. In this model, the clients request services from the servers, which are responsible for processing the requests and providing the appropriate response.</mark> This model is often used in large, centralized networks, where the servers are powerful computers that are capable of handling the requests of multiple clients.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The peer-to-peer model</mark> is a type of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">network in which all devices are considered equal, and can both provide and consume services. In this model, there is no central authority or server, and all devices can communicate and share resources with each other directly. </mark>This model is often used in small, decentralized networks, where the devices are more limited in terms of their processing power and storage capacity.

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The hybrid model</mark> is a combination of the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">client-server and peer-to-peer models. In this model, some devices act as servers, providing services to clients, while other devices act as peers, communicating and sharing resources with each other directly</mark>. This model allows for a more flexible and scalable network, where the workload can be distributed among different types of devices.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Each of these network models has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the appropriate model to use will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the situation.</mark>
##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.2.7 - Understand the characteristics of network topologies</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Network topologies refer to the way in which devices are connected and arranged within a network. The topology of a network can affect its performance, reliability, and scalability, and there are several different types of topologies that are used in different situations.</mark>

One important concept in network topologies is the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">distinction between logical and physical topologies</mark>. The <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">logical topology refers to the way in which data is transmitted and routed within a network, regardless of the physical arrangement of the devices.</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The physical topology, on the other hand, refers to the actual layout and arrangement of the devices within the network.</mark>

One common type of network topology is the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">star topology</mark>, in which<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. This topology is easy to set up and manage, and it allows for easy expansion by adding new devices to the network.</mark> However, it can be vulnerable to failure if the central hub or switch goes down.

Another common type of network topology is the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">mesh topology, in which all devices are connected to each other directly</mark>. This <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">topology provides multiple paths for data to travel, which can improve reliability and fault tolerance</mark>. However, it can be more complex to set up and manage, and it can require a large number of connections.

The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">tree topology</mark> is a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">variation of the star and mesh topologies, in which the network is organized into a hierarchy of devices. This topology allows for the creation of multiple sub-networks, which can be useful in large, complex networks.</mark> However, it can also be vulnerable to failure if a higher-level device goes down.

A VLAN <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">(Virtual Local Area Network)</mark> is a l<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ogical topology that is used to create multiple virtual networks on a single physical network.</mark> <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">VLANs can be used to segment a network into different groups or departments, which can improve security and network performance.</mark> However, they can also be complex to set up and manage, and they require special VLAN-aware devices and infrastructure.


##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.2.8 - Understand the role and characteristics of common components of a network</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A network is a system of devices that are connected together to allow for the exchange of data and information.</mark> There are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">several different components that are commonly used in networks, each of which has its own role and characteristics.</mark>

A <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">server</mark> is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">powerful computer that is responsible for providing services to other devices on the network</mark>. A server typically has a large amount of storage and processing power, and it can host applications, store data, and provide other services to other devices on the network.

An <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Internet connection</mark>, or Internet backbone, is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">high-speed connection to the global Internet. </mark>This connection allows devices on the network to access the vast resources and information available on the Internet, such as websites, online services, and other resources.

A <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">router</mark> is a device that is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">responsible for routing data between different networks</mark>. A router receives data from a source device, determines the best path to the destination device, and forwards the data to the destination. Routers use routing protocols and algorithms to make decisions about how to route data, and they can also provide security and network management functions.

A <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">network switch</mark> is a device that is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">responsible for connecting multiple devices on a network</mark>. A switch receives data from a source device, identifies the destination device, and forwards the data to the destination. Switches can operate at different layers of the network, and they can provide a range of features, such as security, quality of service, and virtual LAN support.

A <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">client</mark> is a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">device that is used to access services and resources provided by servers on the network</mark>. A client can be any type of device, such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet, and it connects to the network to request services from servers. A client typically has limited processing and storage capabilities compared to a server.




##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.2.9 - Understand the seven-layer OSI model to describe how applications communicate over a network, including the function and related protocols of each layer</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework for understanding how applications communicate over a network. The OSI model is divided into seven layers, each of which has a specific function and is related to specific protocols.</mark>

The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">first layer of the OSI model is the physical layer</mark>, which is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a network. This layer defines the electrical, mechanical, and functional characteristics of the physical connection between devices, such as cables, connectors, and switches. The physical layer is related to protocols such as Ethernet and HDMI.

The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">second layer of the OSI model is the data link layer</mark>, which is responsible for the reliable transmission of data over a single link in a network. This layer provides error detection and correction, as well as flow control and access control mechanisms. The data link layer is related to protocols such as IEEE 802.3 and PPP.

The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">third layer of the OSI model is the network layer</mark>, which is responsible for routing data between different networks. This layer provides logical addressing, network topology, and routing services. The network layer is related to protocols such as IP and ICMP.

The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">fourth layer of the OSI model is the transport layer</mark>, which is responsible for providing end-to-end communication and error recovery services. This layer provides segmentation, flow control, and error checking, and it ensures that data is delivered reliably and in the correct order. The transport layer is related to protocols such as TCP and UDP.

The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">fifth layer of the OSI model is the session layer</mark>, which is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections between applications. This layer provides services for establishing and terminating sessions, as well as for managing the flow of data between applications. The session layer is related to protocols such as SCTP and NetBIOS.

The <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">sixth layer of the OSI model is the presentation layer</mark>, which is responsible for translating and formatting data to be presented to the application. This layer provides services for encoding, compression, and encryption of data, as well as for translating between different data formats. The presentation layer is related to protocols such as SSL/TLS and ASCII.

The <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">seventh layer of the OSI model is the application layer</mark>, which is responsible for providing services and interfaces to the applications that use the network. This layer provides services for communication, resource sharing, and data management. The application layer is related to protocols such as HTTP and FTP.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Overall, the OSI model provides a useful framework for understanding how applications communicate over a network.</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Each layer of the model performs a specific function, and the protocols at each layer work together to provide the necessary services and functionality for network communication.</mark>

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.2.10 - Understand the four-layer TCP/IP model to describe how applications communicate over a network, including the function and related protocols of each layer</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is another framework for understanding how applications communicate over a network.</mark> The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">TCP/IP model is similar to the OSI model, but it has a different number and organization of layers.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The application layer of the TCP/IP model</mark> is equivalent to the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">application and presentation layers of the OSI model. This layer provides services and interfaces to the applications that use the network, and it is related to protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP.
</mark>

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The transport layer of the TCP/IP model</mark> is equivalent to the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">transport and session layers of the OSI model. This layer provides end-to-end communication and error recovery services, and it is related to protocols such as TCP and UDP.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The internet layer of the TCP/IP model</mark> is equivalent to the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">network layer of the OSI model. This layer provides routing and logical addressing services, and it is related to the IP protocol.</mark>

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The network access layer of the TCP/IP model</mark> is equivalent to the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">data link and physical layers of the OSI model. This layer provides the physical transmission of data over a network, and it is related to protocols such as Ethernet and WiFi.
</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Overall, the TCP/IP model provides a different way of organizing and understanding the layers and protocols involved in network communication.</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Like the OSI model, the TCP/IP model defines the different functions and protocols that are necessary for applications to communicate over a network.</mark>












##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.2.11 - Understand the role of data packets in transmitting over a network</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Data packets are small units of data that are used to transmit information over a network.</mark> Each <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">packet contains a portion of the overall data that is being transmitted, as well as some additional information that is used for routing and error handling.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The structure of a data packet typically includes a header and a payload.</mark> The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">header contains information about the packet</mark>, such as its source and destination addresses, as well as various flags and control fields. The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">payload contains the actual data that is being transmitted.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The components of a data packet may vary depending on the specific protocol</mark> that is being used. In general, however, a packet will typically include the following components:

-   <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Source address</mark>: The address of the device that is sending the packet.
-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Destination address</mark>: The address of the device that is intended to receive the packet.
-   <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Protocol</mark>: The protocol that is being used to transmit the packet.
-   <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Sequence number</mark>: A number that is used to identify the order of the packet in the overall data stream.
-   <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Checksum</mark>: A value that is calculated based on the contents of the packet, and that is used for error detection.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Packet switching is the process of dividing a large amount of data into smaller packets</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">transmitting the packets over the network, and reassembling the packets at the destination.</mark> This <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">allows for efficient and flexible transmission of data</mark>, as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">packets can be routed independently and can take different paths through the network.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Error handling is an important aspect of packet transmission,</mark> and it is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">typically achieved through the use of checksums and error-correction algorithms.</mark> A <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">checksum is a value that is calculated based on the contents of the packet, and that is used to detect errors in the packet</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If an error is detected, the packet can be retransmitted, or an error-correction algorithm can be used to try to reconstruct the original data.</mark> One <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">common error-detection method is the CRC</mark> (Cyclic Redundancy Check), which uses a mathematical formula to calculate a checksum based on the contents of the packet.

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.2.12 - Understand the role of common network protocols.</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A network protocol is a set of rules and conventions that define how devices on a network communicate with each other</mark>. There are many <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">different network protocols, each of which serves a specific purpose and has its own characteristics and features.</mark>

**Some common network protocols include the following:**

-   <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">TCP</mark> (Transmission Control Protocol): <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">TCP is a transport layer protocol that provides reliable, end-to-end communication between devices on a network.</mark> It is used for applications that require a consistent and error-free transmission of data, such as web browsing and email.
-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">IP</mark> (Internet Protocol): IP is a<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> network layer protocol that provides addressing and routing services for devices on a network.</mark> It is used to determine the path that data should take through the network, and to deliver data to the correct destination.
-   <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">HTTP</mark> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">HTTP is an application layer protocol that is used for communication between web clients and servers.</mark> It is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and it is used to request and transmit web pages and other resources over the Internet.
-   <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">HTTPS</mark> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): H<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">TTPS is a variant of HTTP that provides additional security by encrypting the data that is transmitted between the client and the server.</mark> It is commonly used for sensitive applications, such as online banking and shopping.
-   <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">FTP</mark> (File Transfer Protocol): <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">FTP is an application layer protocol that is used for transferring files between computers on a network.</mark> It is commonly used for transferring large files, such as software updates and backups.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Overall, network protocols play a critical role in enabling communication and data exchange between devices on a network</mark>. They <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">provide the rules and conventions that allow devices to understand and interpret the data that is being transmitted</mark>, and they <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">enable the efficient and reliable transmission of data across networks.</mark>
##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.2.13 - Understand how physical, virtual and cloud environments, along with networks, are used in combination, including the Internet of Things (IoT), to solve problems and meet the needs of organisations and their stakeholders</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Physical, virtual, and cloud environments, along with networks, can be used in combination to solve problems and meet the needs of organizations and their stakeholders.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">A physical environment refers to the physical devices,</mark> infrastructure, and resources that are used in a network or system. This includes computers, servers, routers, switches, and other hardware that is used to store and process data, as well as the physical connections and networks that are used to transmit data.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A virtual environment refers to a simulated or virtualized version of a physical environment</mark>. In a virtual environment, the hardware and software resources are abstracted and emulated, allowing multiple virtual environments to be run on the same physical hardware. This can provide benefits such as increased flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency.
