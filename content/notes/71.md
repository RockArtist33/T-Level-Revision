##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.1.5 Understand how physical data storage and recovery systems work, their features, benefits and drawbacks:</mark>
<mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">PROS</mark> / <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">CONS</mark>
- **redundant array of independent disks (RAID)**
	- **RAID 1**
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">RAID 1 is a type of disk array configuration that is used to improve the performance, reliability, and security of a computer's storage system.</mark> In a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">RAID 1 configuration, two or more physical disks are combined into a single logical disk (virtual disks), with the data being mirrored across the disks. This means that the same data is written to each of the disks in the array, providing redundancy and fault tolerance.</mark>

		- The key benefits and advantages of RAID 1 include:

			-   <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Improved performance,</mark> by allowing the computer to access data from multiple disks in parallel, which can increase the speed and throughput of the storage system
			-   <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Enhanced reliability</mark>, by providing redundant copies of the data on each of the disks in the array, which can help to prevent data loss in the event of a disk failure or other error
			-   <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Improved security,</mark> by providing data mirroring, which can protect against data loss or corruption due to hardware failure, power outages, or other issues
			-   <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Increased flexibility</mark>, by allowing the disks in the array to be easily added, removed, or replaced, without affecting the operation or availability of the data
			-   <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Enhanced support</mark>, by providing support for a wide range of hardware and software platforms, and by allowing the RAID 1 configuration to be easily integrated into existing storage systems.
		- Though it s<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hould be mentioned that this configuration does mean that you have less drive space overall and hotswapping drives may not be a possibility for the disks.</mark>
	- **RAID 5**
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">RAID 5 uses striping to then divide data across multiple disks and also has parity data that is designed to be able to reconstruct the missing data based on what the other disks has on that data. This  then makes it differnet from all other RAID levels due to its functionality.</mark>
		- This then means that it has quite a few benefits which are:
			- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">RAID 5 is very efficient for data storage,</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">it has the ability for very high read speeds</mark> due to the striping of data allowing for simultaneous reading of data.
			- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">it is less expensive</mark> when compared to the cost of other RAID levels
			- T<mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">here is a very good balance between fault tolerance, security and performance for the drive system</mark>
		- Though there are several disadvantages such as:
			- <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">Drive failures will affect the read and write times for the data</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">The technology used is quite complex so restoration of the data from damaged disks will take some time.</mark>
	- **RAID 10**
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> RAID 10 is a disk array configuration which combines both RAID 1 and RAID 0, 4 or more disks are required for this to operate and all of these disks are combined into a single logical disk, The data is then striped across the sets of disks and then they are mirrored so that both sets of disks have the same striped data</mark>
		- The benefits for these are that:
			- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">since there are multiple sets of drives with mirrored and striped data</mark>, a loss of a drive due to failure will likely not affect any of the data at all.
			- Since the data is mirrored on sets of disks, the <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">read and write times will be much faster due to there being more drives</mark> it can access for the data.
			- To recover the data, <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">RAID 10 has a faster process of recovery</mark>.
		- Though disadvantages of RAID 10 are:
			- <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">It is costly to obtain the number of disks required,</mark> obtain housing, maintain the disks and keep those disks online.
			- The <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">storage of RAID 10 is half of the possible storage without raid 10 since it mirrors data among the disks.</mark>
			- If <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">both mirrored disks fail, the data is lost.</mark>
- **Network Attached Storage** (NAS)
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Network attached storage (NAS) is a type of storage system that is connected to a computer network, allowing users to access data and share data and resources over the network. NAS systems typically consist of one or more hard drives, which are connected to a network-attached storage device, such as a server The NAS device provides the interface between the hard drives and the network, allowing users to access the data on the hard drives from any device that is connected to the network.</mark>
	- These systems have many advantages, some being:
		- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Easy access to data and resources</mark>, by providing users with the ability to access and share data and resources over the network, from any device that is connected to the network
		- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Improved performance and reliability</mark>, by providing high-speed access to the data and resources on the NAS, and by providing features such as data redundancy and error correction, which can help to prevent data loss and corruption
		- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Enhanced security</mark>, by providing features such as access control and encryption, which can protect the data and resources on the NAS from unauthorized access or tampering
		- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Increased flexibility and scalability</mark>, by allowing the NAS to be easily expanded and upgraded, by adding more hard drives or upgrading the existing drives, without affecting the operation or availability of the data and resources
		- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Enhanced support,</mark> by providing support for a wide range of file systems, protocols, and applications, and by allowing the NAS to be easily integrated into existing networks and storage systems.
	- Though there are drawbacks for this system, some being:
		- <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">The performance of the NAS device depends on the chosen protocol that the NAS device uses.</mark> An inefficient protocol will decrease the performance drastically.
		- <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">The amount of traffic on the network will vastly increase due to the sending and retrieval of data and resources from the NAS</mark> device putting strain on the entire network
		- <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">The NAS device will slow down if large file transfers happen or if video processing is needed fro a certain application.</mark>
- **Storage Area Network** (SAN)
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">This is a high-speed network dedicated to the connection between storage devices and clients. This connection provides the ability for users to send and rertieve files over the network to and from the storage devices connected to the network. The storage devices connected can range from HDDs to Tape drives.</mark>
	- The key advantages of SANs are:
		- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">The issues relating to bandwidth which happens on LAN based storage devices do not happen on SAN as they are dedicated to file transfer and retrieval decreasing the congestion on both the SAN and the LAN making both systems faster.</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">Data is more secure</mark> because the critical data is stored on a separate network so even if someone broke into your LAN, they would have no access to the SAN which has all of the critical data.
		- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">It is easier to backup data on a SAN</mark> due to you only needing a single backup server
		- <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">It is easy to scale up or down a SAN</mark> based on what you need at this current time since you can just add or remove storage to the network at any time.
	- The key disadvantages are:
		- <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">It is costly to have a separates SAN as you need to maintain both your LAN and your SAN making costs for both increase</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">They can only be effectively used in use cases where the organisation or person stores all their data within themselves</mark> and if they use cloud services for data storage for example, it likely isnt warranted to utilise a SAN
