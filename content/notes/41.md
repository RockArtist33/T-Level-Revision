Second,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> international law helps to promote cooperation and coordination between the UK and other countries and regions in relation to digital systems</mark>. This can be important for the development of global standards and best practices, and for the resolution of disputes that may arise in relation to the use of digital systems in the UK.

Third, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">international law can provide a basis for the enforcement of legal rights and obligations in relation to digital systems in the UK</mark>, including the right to seek redress in the event of a violation of those rights. This can help to protect individuals and organizations in the UK from harm and ensure that they are able to use digital systems without fear of unfair treatment or abuse.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Overall, the role of legislation relating to international law is essential for the design, development, and use of digital systems in the UK</mark>, and is an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">important part of ensuring that these systems are used in a way that is fair, safe, and compliant with legal requirements in the country.</mark>
