##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.5.1 - Understand the benefits and drawbacks of using pre-written code.</mark>

<mark style="background: #00FF01A6;">PROS</mark>

-   <mark style="background: #00FF01A6;">It can save time and effort</mark>: Using pre-written code can save developers the time and effort of writing code from scratch. This can be especially useful for common or repetitive tasks, or for tasks that require specialized knowledge or expertise.
-   <mark style="background: #00FF01A6;">It can improve code quality</mark>: Pre-written code is often written by experienced developers who have a deep understanding of best practices and design patterns. As a result, pre-written code can be of higher quality than code written by less experienced developers.
-   <mark style="background: #00FF01A6;">It can promote consistency</mark>: Pre-written code can help to ensure consistency across a project or organization, by providing a standardized approach to solving common problems. This can make it easier to maintain and modify code over time.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">CONS</mark>

-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">It may not be tailored to your specific needs</mark>: Pre-written code is often designed to be general-purpose and may not be optimized for your specific use case or requirements. This can lead to inefficiencies or limitations in the code.
-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">It may be more difficult to understand and modify</mark>: Pre-written code is often written by someone other than the person using it, which can make it more difficult to understand or modify. This can make it harder to integrate the code into your project, or to adapt it to changing requirements.
-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">It may have licensing or compatibility issues</mark>: Pre-written code may be subject to licensing restrictions or may be incompatible with other software or libraries that you are using. This can limit your ability to use the code or may require you to pay additional fees.

Overall, the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">decision to use pre-written code should be based on the specific needs and goals of your project</mark>. In some cases, the benefits of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">using pre-written code may outweigh the disadvantages, while in other cases it may be more effective to write code from scratch</mark>.

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.5.2 - Be able to select and justify the use of pre-written code provided by the Python programming language (e.g. built-in functions, standard libraries).</mark>
One possible way to select and justify the use of pre-written code provided by the Python programming language is to first <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">identify the specific needs and goals of your project</mark>. For example, you might need to perform complex mathematical calculations, manipulate data in a specific format, or interact with a specific database or network protocol.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Once you have identified your specific needs, you can then review the available pre-written code provided by the Python programming language to determine whether it can help you to achieve your goals</mark>. For example, the Python standard library includes a wide range of built-in functions and modules for performing common tasks such as working with strings, numbers, and collections, as well as more specialized tasks such as handling dates and times, working with files and directories, and interacting with network protocols.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">To justify the use of pre-written code, you can evaluate the quality and reliability of the code, and compare it to the alternatives.</mark> For example, you might argue that the pre-written code is well-documented and widely used by other developers, and has been thoroughly tested and proven to be reliable. You might also consider the potential benefits of using pre-written code, such as the time and effort it can save you by providing a ready-made solution to a common problem.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In addition, you should also consider the compatibility of the pre-written code with your project, and evaluate any licensing or compatibility issues that may arise.</mark> For example, you might need to ensure that the pre-written code is compatible with the other libraries or frameworks that you are using, and that it does not violate any licensing restrictions.

Overall, the decision to use <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pre-written code provided by the Python programming language should be based on a careful evaluation of your specific needs and goals</mark>, as well as the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">quality and reliability of the code</mark>, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">any potential compatibility or licensing issues.</mark> By carefully considering these factors, you can make an informed decision about whether and how to use pre-written code in your project.


##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.5.3 - Be able to write code that makes use of user-written and pre-written code (e.g. built-in functions, standard libraries).</mark>
Here is a simple Python code example that uses built-in functions and standard libraries:

```python
# Import the `random` module from the Python standard library
import random

# Generate a random integer between 1 and 10
random_int = random.randint(1, 10)

# Print the random integer
print(random_int)

# Convert the random integer to a string and store it in a variable
random_int_str = str(random_int)

# Use the `join` method from the `string` module to concatenate the string with a message
message = "The random number is: " + "".join(random_int_str)

# Print the message
print(message)
```

In this code, we use the ` random ` module from the Python standard library to generate a random integer between 1 and 10. We then use the ` str ` built-in function to convert the integer to a string, and the ` join ` method from the ` string ` module to concatenate the string with a message. Finally, we use the ` print ` built-in function to output the message to the console. This code demonstrates how to use built-in functions and standard libraries in Python to perform common tasks such as generating random numbers and manipulating strings.
