</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">There are several different cloud delivery models, each of which has its own characteristics and defines the way in which responsibility and ownership of resources are distributed between the subscriber and the service provider.</mark>

The three most common cloud delivery models are:

-   <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Infrastructure as a Service</mark> (IaaS): In this model, the service <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">provider provides the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking, and the subscriber is responsible for managing and configuring the operating system, applications, and data.</mark> This model provides the greatest flexibility and control to the subscriber, but it also requires the most technical expertise.
-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Platform as a Service</mark> (PaaS): In this model, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the service provider provides a platform, such as an operating system or development environment, and the subscriber is responsible for managing and configuring the applications and data.</mark> This model provides a pre-configured and managed platform, but it may have less flexibility and control than the IaaS model.
-   <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Software as a Service</mark> (SaaS):<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> In this model, the service provider provides a complete application or service, and the subscriber is responsible for using the application or service.</mark> This model provides the least amount of flexibility and control to the subscriber, but it requires the least technical expertise.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In general, the distribution of responsibility and ownership of resources in cloud delivery models depends on the specific model and the agreement between the subscriber and the service provider. </mark>The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">subscriber typically has more control and responsibility in the IaaS and PaaS models</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">while the service provider has more control and responsibility in the SaaS model.</mark>

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">7.4.3 - Understand the concept of DaaS (Data as a Service)</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Data as a Service (DaaS) is a model for providing data and analytics services to users over the Internet.</mark> In a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">DaaS model, the service provider manages and maintains a platform that includes various data science tools and technologies, and the subscriber can access and use the platform to perform data analytics and other tasks.</mark>

Some of the tools and technologies that may be included in a DaaS platform are:

-   <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Data science platforms</mark>: These are platforms that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">provide tools and technologies for data analysis, machine learning, and other advanced analytics tasks. </mark>Examples include Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio.

-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Dashboards</mark>: These are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">interactive visualizations that allow users to monitor and analyze data in real-time.</mark> Examples include Tableau and PowerBI.

-   <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Business intelligence tools</mark>: These are tools that<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> allow users to analyze and report on business data.</mark> Examples include Cognos and Qlik.

-   <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Data lakes</mark>: These are large <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">repositories of structured and unstructured data that can be accessed and queried for analytics purposes.</mark> Examples include Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

-   <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Databases</mark>: These are systems that are used to store and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">manage structured data</mark>. Examples include MySQL and SQL Server.

-   <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">File systems</mark>: These are systems that are used to <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">store and manage unstructured data</mark>. Examples include HDFS and S3.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Overall, DaaS provides a way for organizations to access and use advanced data analytics tools and technologies without having to manage and maintain the underlying infrastructure.</mark> This can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">provide benefits such as cost-efficiency, flexibility, and scalability.</mark>
