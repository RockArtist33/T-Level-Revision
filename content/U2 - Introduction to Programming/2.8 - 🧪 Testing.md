##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.8.1 - Understand the fundamental importance of testing for all components</mark>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Software**
	- Software <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ensures that a piece of software performs as expected and meets the requirements and specifications</mark> set forth by the developers. Testing can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">help identify and fix bugs and other issues before the software is released to users</mark>. This can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">prevent user frustration and improve the overall quality of the software</mark>. Additionally, testing can help e<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nsure that the software is reliable and able to handle a variety of scenarios and inputs</mark>. This is especially important for mission-critical software, where even a small error can have serious consequences. Overall, testing is a crucial step in the software development process that helps ensure that the final product is of high quality and meets the needs of users.
- **Hardware**
	 - It <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">allows designers and manufacturers to ensure that a piece of hardware is reliable</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">functional</mark>, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">safe to use</mark>. Testing can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">help identify potential problems or issues with a design, and allow engineers to make changes or improvements before a product is released to the market</mark>. Without proper testing, a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">piece of hardware could fail or malfunction, leading to potentially dangerous situations or costly recalls.</mark> Therefore, testing is an essential part of the hardware development process and helps ensure that a product will work as intended and meet the needs of its users.
- **Data**
	- It helps ensure that the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">data we are working with is accurate and reliable</mark>. By conducting tests on our data, we can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">identify any potential issues or errors and address them before using the data for analysis or making decisions.</mark> This is especially important in fields like healthcare and finance, where even small errors in the data can have significant consequences. Testing also helps us to<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> gain confidence in our data and the results that we are able to generate from it</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Without testing, we may be basing our decisions on faulty or incomplete data, which can lead to incorrect or misleading conclusions.</mark>
- **Interfaces**
	- The user interface is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">primary way that users interact with a software application</mark>, and if it is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not functioning correctly, it can lead to a poor user experience</mark>. Testing an interface <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ensures that it is working as intended and that it is easy for users to navigate and use</mark>. It also helps to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">identify and fix any bugs or issues before the software is released to the public</mark>. This can save time and resources in the long run by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">preventing the need for costly and time-consuming updates and fixes</mark> after the software has been released.
- **Final product**
	- It ensures that the product is of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">high quality and is free of defects or bugs.</mark> This is especially <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">important for products that will be used by customers</mark>, as it can help to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">improve customer satisfaction and build trust in the brand</mark>. This can help to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ensure that the product is fit for its intended purpose</mark> and meets the needs of the customer, testing is a crucial step in the development process that helps to ensure that the final product is of high quality, free of defects, and meets the needs of the customer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.8.2 - Understand the use of testing and quality assurance methodologies to seek out problems and issues</mark>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **concept testing**
	- Concept testing (to be distinguished from pre-test markets and test markets which may be used at a later stage of product development research) is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">process of using surveys</mark> (and sometimes qualitative methods) to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">evaluate consumer acceptance</mark> of a new product idea prior to the introduction of a product to the market.
- **unit testing**
	- In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">individual units of source code</mark>, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures are tested <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">to determine whether they are fit for use.</mark>
- **boundary testing**	
	- Boundary Testing is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">value analysis</mark>, a type of black box or specification based testing technique in which tests are performed using the boundary values. The goal of boundary testing is to ensure that the system can handle <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">input values that are at the edge of the acceptable range these are called extremes or edge cases</mark>.
- **integration testing** 
	- Integration testing is the phase in software <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">testing in which individual software modules</mark> are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">combined and tested as a group</mark>. Integration testing is conducted to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements.</mark>
- **performance testing**
	- Performance testing is in general a testing practice performed to determine <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload</mark>. It can also serve to investigate, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">measure, validate or verify other quality attributes of the system</mark>, such as scalability.
- **system testing** 
	- System testing is testing conducted on a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">complete integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements.</mark> System testing takes, as its input, all of the integrated components that have passed integration testing. The purpose of integration testing is to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">detect any inconsistencies between the units that are integrated together.</mark>
- **acceptance and usability testing**
	- Acceptance testing is a test <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met</mark>. It may <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">involve chemical tests, physical tests, or performance tests.</mark>
- **regression testing**
	- Regression testing (rarely, non-regression testing) is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change.</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If not, that would be called a regression.</mark>
- **load/stress testing.**
	- Load testing is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">process of putting demand on a structure or system and measuring its response.</mark>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.8.3 - Understand how automated and functional testing tools can be applied to test digital systems and code.</mark>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Automated</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">functional</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">both</mark>

These tools can be used to test digital systems and code in a number of ways. Automated testing tools can be used to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">automate the execution of tests</mark>, which can <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">help to save time and reduce the need for manual testing</mark>. Functional testing tools, on the other hand, can be used to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">test the functionality of a system or application to ensure that it behaves as expected.</mark>

One way in which automated testing tools <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">can be used is to create and run test scripts that exercise the different features and functions of a digital system or application</mark>. These scripts can be <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">designed to test different aspects of the system, such as its user interface, performance, or reliability. The test scripts can then be run automatically, and the results can be recorded and analysed to identify any defects or issues.</mark>

Functional testing tools, on the other hand, can be used to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">test the functionality of a system or application by simulating the actions of a user and checking that the system behaves as expected.</mark> For example, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">a functional testing tool might be used to simulate a user clicking on a button in a user interface, and then check that the system responds appropriately.</mark>

Overall, automated and functional testing tools can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">be used to quickly and efficiently test digital systems and code,</mark> helping to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ensure that they are of high quality and free of defects</mark>. These tools <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can be used in combination with other testing techniques to provide a comprehensive view of the system's behaviour.</mark>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.8.4 - Understand how to apply root cause analysis to solve problems</mark>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **what it is**
	- Its the 5 Whys, this strategy <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">involves looking at any problem and asking: “Why?”</mark> and “What caused this problem?” V<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ery often, the answer to the first “why” will prompt another “why” and the answer to the second “why” will prompt another and so on; hence the name the 5 Whys strategy.</mark>
- **when to use it** 
	- Typically used when a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">problem or issue has been identified</mark>, and there is a need <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">to understand the underlying causes of the problem in order to come up with a solution</mark>.
- **how to use it** 
	1.  Why is the product defective?
	2.  Why did the defect occur?
	3.  Why was the defect not detected earlier?
	4.  Why was the process not properly followed?
	5.  Why was the process not properly designed?
- **what next.**
	- The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">information can be used to come up with a solution to prevent the problem from happening in the future.</mark>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.8.5 - Understand how to construct an effective test plan, including</mark>
- **identifying tests to be carried out & describing the purpose of the identified test**
	
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">concept testing</mark>: just asking others opinions. comparing testing
	
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">boundary testing</mark>: checks the extreme ends of input in software.
	
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">integration testing</mark>: testing the individual modules as combined and tested as a group
	
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">performance testing</mark>: test how well it actually performance and see if someone can enter it i.e. hacking .
	
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">system testing</mark>: testing the fully integrated software product. testing end to end system.
	
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">regression testing</mark>: tests to check if a program has not been broken by a change in code.
	
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">load tests</mark>:help you understand how a a system behavior under an expected load
	
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">stress test</mark>:pushes the system to its upper limit using a load beyond the expected maximum
- **identifying test data to be used** 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">valid</mark>
		- Sensible<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> data that the program should accept</mark> and should <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not cause the program to break if all things are working correctly</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">valid extreme</mark>
		- Data that falls at the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">edges/boundaries of the accepted possible range</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">invalid</mark>
		- Data that the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">system/application should not accept and should cause the program to have an error which needs handling</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">invalid extreme</mark>
		- Data that is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">invalid but only just at the extremes</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">erroneous</mark>
		- Data which is<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> not valid and does meet the correct format and should be rejected</mark>
- **describing the expected results.**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Expected Results</mark>
		- What results are you expecting if the program was working as it should?
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Actual Results</mark>
		- What happens when the test is run?
		This is where you will see if the functionality you are testing works or not as you compare it to the expected result and if they do not match, the test is classed as failing and requires fixing
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Comments/Actions</mark>
		- What were the actions taken to fix the error if they did occur?
		Any general comments about the test and how it went and if it was a success or failure
	-  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Making Changes</mark>
		- When making the actual change for your failed code, you must ensure you always re run the tests completely to ensure your fix did not break any other part of the code base. This is called regression testing
