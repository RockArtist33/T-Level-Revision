##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.2.1 - Understand the purpose of, and how to use, mathematical operators in program code and algorithms (add, subtract, divide, multiply, integer division, modulus)</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Mathematical operators are used in program code and algorithms to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division</mark>. These operators can be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">used to perform calculations on variables and values in a program</mark>, which can then be used to make decisions or control the flow of the program.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The purpose of using mathematical operators in program code and algorithms is to enable the computer to perform mathematical operations and make decisions based on the results of those operations</mark>. This is an essential part of many types of programs, from simple calculators to complex artificial intelligence systems.

T<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">o use mathematical operators in program code, you need to know the syntax of the programming</mark> language you are using. In most programming languages, mathematical operations are performed using the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">standard mathematical operators</mark>:

-   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Addition</mark> is performed using the ` + ` operator
-   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Subtraction</mark> is performed using the ` - ` operator
-   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Multiplication</mark> is performed using the ` * ` operator
-   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Division</mark> is performed using the ` / ` operator

In addition to these standard mathematical operators, some programming languages also provide additional operators for performing more advanced mathematical operations, such as:

-   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Integer division</mark> is performed using the ` // ` operator. This divides two numbers and returns the integer part of the result, discarding any fractional part.
-   <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Modulus</mark> is performed using the ` % ` operator. This divides two numbers and returns the remainder of the division.

To use these operators in your code, you would write an expression using the appropriate operator, with the values or variables that you want to operate on on either side of the operator. For example, to add two numbers `x` and `y` and store the result in a variable `z`, you would write the following code:

```python
z + x = y
```

This code would add the values of `x` and `y` together and store the result in the variable `z`. You can then use the value of `z` in other parts of your program, or perform further operations on it using other mathematical operators.

Overall, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mathematical operators are a crucial part of many types of program code and algorithms</mark>, and are used to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">perform a wide range of mathematical operations.</mark> By understanding how to use these operators and how they work, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">you can write more powerful and efficient programs</mark>.

			else:
			 print("false")
		```
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">OR</mark>
	- checks if either two thing are something
		```python
			x = 5
			y = 10
			if x or y == 10:
			 print("true") # will print true
		```
