<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.3.1 - Understand how to use text files for input and output of data</mark>

To use text files for input and output of data in a program, you will need to follow a few basic steps. First, you will need to open the text file using the appropriate function or method for the programming language you are using. For example, in the Python programming language, you might use the ` open() ` function to open a text file like this:

```python
f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
```

This code opens the file "myfile.txt" for reading in the "r" (read) mode. The file handle (`f` in this example) can then be used to read from or write to the file.

To read data from the text file, you can use the ` read() ` method of the file handle. For example, you might use the following code to read the entire contents of the file:

```python
contents = f.read()
```

This code reads the entire contents of the file into the ` contents ` variable. You can then use the `contents` variable to access the data that was read from the file.

To write data to the text file, you can use the ` write() ` method of the file handle. For example, you might use the following code to write a string to the file:

Copy code

```python
f.write("Hello, world!")
```

This code writes the string "Hello, world!" to the file. You can write any data that can be represented as a string to the file using this method.

Once you have finished reading from or writing to the text file, you should close the file using the ` close() ` method of the file handle. For example:


```python
f.close()
```

This code closes the file and releases any resources that were associated with the file handle.

Overall, using text files for input and output of data in a program involves opening the file, reading from or writing to the file, and then closing the file when you are finished. By following these steps, you can easily read and write data to text files in your program.

```python
#we open the file
f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
#read the contents and assign them to a variable
contents = f.read()
#we write hello world inside or that txt file
f.write("Hello, world!")
#we then close the file
f.close()

```
