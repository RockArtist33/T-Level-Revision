##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.1.1 Understand the use of, and need for, data types</mark>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **String** 
	- a sequence of characters 
- **Character**
	- Unit of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">information that roughly corresponds</mark> to a grapheme, grapheme-like unit, or symbol, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">such as in an alphabet</mark> or syllabary in the written form of a natural language. 
- **Integer** 
	- A number 
- **Real/float** 
	- A number with decimal places
- **Boolean.** 
	- Two possible values True and False
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.1.2 Be able to declare and use constants and variables that use appropriate data types.</mark>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To declare and use constants and variables in a programming language, you will need to follow a few basic steps. First, you will need to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">decide on the appropriate data type for the constant or variable</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Different programming languages have different data types, but some common examples include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Booleans.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Once you have decided on the appropriate data type, you will need to declare the constant or variable using the appropriate syntax for the programming language you are using.</mark> For example, in the Python programming language, you might declare a constant like this:

```python
constant = 50
int myvariable = 10

#we can than use these to create an output

total = constant + myvariable
print(total)
```

Overall, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">declaring and using constants and variables in a programming language involves choosing the appropriate data type,</mark> declaring the constant or variable <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">using the appropriate syntax</mark>, and then using the constant or variable in your code by referencing its name.

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.1.3 Understand the use of, and need for, data structures</mark> 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 **● list**
```python
# accsessing items form a list
country = ["Spain","Newzeland","Germany"]
cost = [200,300,150,120]
avaliable = [True,False]
random = [2,"banana",True,23,4]

print(country[1])   # list starts count from 0
print(cost[2])      # so 0 would be the first variable
print(avaliable[1]) # 5 would be the sixth variable
print(random[4])

print(country[0:2])    # list also starts at 0 but closes at +1
print(cost[1:4])       # so if apple and pear and pineapple are called
print(avaliable[1:3])  # and i only want an apple and pear, it would
print(random[2:6])     # look like [0:3], as it gets values inbetween

if "spain" in country:print("its in the list") # if "spain" is edited the output 
else:print("its not in the list")              # would be false as its not in list

# changing an elements in a list

country[0] = "Poland"
print(country)

# Adding an item to the end of a list

country.append("Italy")
print(country)

# adding an item to a list in a certain position

country.insert(2,"Australia")
print(country)

#extending (joining) lists together

country.extend(cost) # adds whatsever in the brackets e.g cost to the starting
print(country)       # list e.g country, adding cost to country

# removing an item from a list and removing from an index number

cost.remove(300)
print(cost)

cost.pop(0)
print(cost)

line() # clears/emptys the enitre list

cost.clear()
print(cost)
```
**● array** 
```python
# create an array of numbers
my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# access an element in the array by its index
print(my_numbers[2])  # prints 3

# modify an element in the array by its index
my_numbers[3] = 10
print(my_numbers[3])  # prints 10

```
**● dictionary**
```python
my_dict = {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2",
    "key3": "value3"
}
value = my_dict["key2"]
```

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.1.4 Understand how to manage variables within a program, including</mark>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a program, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">variables are used to store and manage data</mark>. Variables can be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">either local or global</mark>, and the choice of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">which type to use depends on the specific needs of the program</mark>.

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Local variables are variables that are declared and used within a specific function or block of code</mark>. They are <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">only accessible within the function or block where they are declared</mark>, and they are <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">not accessible from outside that function or block</mark>. Local variables are <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">useful for storing temporary data that is only needed within the function or block</mark> where they are declared, and they can <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">help to avoid conflicts with global variables</mark> that have the same name.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Global variables, on the other hand, are variables that are declared and used outside of any specific function or block of code</mark>. They are <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">accessible from anywhere in the program</mark>, and they can be <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">used to store data that needs to be shared across multiple functions or blocks</mark>. Global variables are <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">useful for storing data that is used throughout the program</mark>, but they <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">can also cause conflicts if multiple functions or blocks try to modify the same global variable.</mark>

In general, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">local variables should be used whenever possible, because they are more specific and have a smaller scope</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Global variables should be used only when the data they store needs to be shared across multiple functions or blocks.</mark>

In terms of naming conventions, v<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ariables should be given meaningful names</mark> that accurately reflect the data they store. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">This can make the code easier to read and understand, and it can help to avoid confusion.</mark>

In terms of case, there are several conventions that are commonly used for naming variables. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Camel case, also known as lower camel case, is a convention where the first word is lowercase and subsequent words are capitalized,</mark> with no spaces or punctuation. For example, "myVariable" is an example of a camel case variable name.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">UPPER CASE, also known as all caps, is a convention where all the letters in the variable name are capitalized</mark>, with no spaces or punctuation. For example, "MY_VARIABLE" is an example of an UPPER CASE variable name.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Ultimately, the choice of naming convention is a matter of personal preference</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">and the specific needs of the program</mark>. The important thing is to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">choose a convention and be consistent in its use.</mark>
