##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.4.1 - Understand how sequence, selection (branching) and iteration are used within programs and algorithms</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A sequence</mark> is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">set of instructions in a program or algorithm that are executed in a specific order.</mark> For example, a program that calculates the average of a set of numbers may first ask the user for input, then perform the calculation, and finally print the result to the screen. This would be considered a sequence of instructions because each step is performed in a specific order.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Selection</mark>, or branching, is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">control flow structure that allows a program to choose which instructions to execute based on a certain condition.</mark> For example, a program that calculates the average of a set of numbers may include a branching statement that checks whether the user has entered any numbers. If the user has not entered any numbers, the program might print an error message and stop executing. If the user has entered numbers, the program would continue to the next step in the sequence and perform the calculation.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Iteration</mark> is the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> repetition of a set of instructions in a program or algorithm.</mark> This is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">often done using a loop,</mark> which is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a control flow structure that allows a program to execute a set of instructions multiple times. </mark>For example, a program that calculates the average of a set of numbers might use a loop to iterate over each of the numbers that the user has entered and add them together. After all of the numbers have been added, the program would divide the sum by the total number of numbers to calculate the average.

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.4.2 - Be able to write, interpret and debug code that makes use of sequence
</mark>

-  **Determine the most efficient and logical order for actions within a process.**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">To determine the most efficient and logical order for actions within a process</mark>, you need to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">consider the specific requirements of the process and the steps involved</mark>. In general, it is best to start with the most important or critical steps and work your way down to the less important or less critical steps. This will ensure that the most important actions are completed first and that any problems or errors are caught early on in the process.
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Additionally, you should try to minimize the number of branching statements and loops in your code,</mark> as these can make the code more complex and harder to understand. Instead, you should strive to use clear, concise code that is easy to read and understand. T<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">his will make it easier to debug and maintain your code, and will help you to write more efficient and effective programs.</mark>
	
	- To further improve the efficiency and logical order of your code, you can also consider the following factors:
	
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Data dependencies:</mark> If there are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dependencies between different steps in the process</mark>, you should ensure that these dependencies are respected and that the steps are executed in the correct order. For example, if step 2 relies on the output of step 1, step 1 should be executed before step 2.
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Parallelism</mark>: If certain <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">steps in the process can be executed in parallel,</mark> you should try to arrange your code in a way that allows these steps to be executed simultaneously. This can help to improve the overall performance of the process.
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Reuse</mark>: If certain steps in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">process can be reused or shared across different parts</mark> of the code, you should try to consolidate these steps into common functions or modules. This will make your code more modular and easier to maintain.
	
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Overall</mark>, the most <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">efficient and logical order for actions within a process</mark> will depend on the specific requirements of the process and the nature of the steps involved. By considering these factors and using clear, concise code, you can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your programs and algorithms.
- **Understand the correct order of operations in calculations and processes, to ensure outputs are accurate and errors are avoided.**
	- The correct order of operations in calculations and processes is a<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> set of rules that dictate the sequence in which different operations should be performed</mark>. These rules ensure that calculations are performed in a consistent and predictable manner, and that the output of a calculation or process is accurate and free of errors.

		The most common set of rules for the correct order of operations is the order of operations used in arithmetic, which is often abbreviated as<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">BIDMAS</mark> or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">PEMDAS.</mark> These rules specify that operations should be performed in the following order:
		
		1.  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Brackets</mark>: Any calculations inside brackets should be performed first.
		2.  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Indicies</mark> (or exponents): Any calculations involving exponents should be performed next.
		3.  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Division</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">multiplication</mark>: Division and multiplication should be performed next, working from left to right.
		4.  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Addition</mark> and subtraction: Finally, addition and subtraction should be performed, working from left to right.
	- In addition to the order of operations used in arithmetic, there are<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> also rules for the correct order of operations in other types of calculations and processes</mark>. For example, in computer programming, the order of operations is typically determined by the specific rules of the programming language being used.

	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Overall, understanding and following the correct order of operations is crucial for ensuring that calculations and processes are performed accurately</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">without errors</mark>. By using the appropriate rules and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">applying them consistently, you can avoid common mistakes and produce accurate and reliable results.</mark>
##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.4.3 - Be able to write, interpret and debug code that makes use of selection (branching)</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The IF statement is used to evaluate a condition</mark>, and if the condition is true, it will execute a block of code. For example:

```python
if condition:     
 code to execute if condition is true
```

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The THEN statement is used in some programming languages to specify the code that should be executed if the condition in an IF statement is true</mark>. However, in most modern programming languages, the code to be executed is simply placed after the IF statement, without using a THEN statement.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The ELSE statement is used in combination with the IF statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition in the IF statement is false</mark>. For example:

```python
if condition:
    code to execute if condition is true
else:
    code to execute if condition is false
```

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The ELSEIF (or ELIF) statement is used in combination with the IF and ELSE statements to specify additional conditions to be checked</mark>. If the condition in the IF statement is false, the ELSEIF statement will be evaluated, and if its condition is true, the code in its block will be executed. For example:


```python
if condition1:
	code to execute if condition1 is true
elseif condition2:
	code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
else:
	code to execute if condition1 and condition2 are false
```

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The CASE statement is used to evaluate multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code depending on the condition that is met</mark>. For example:

```python
case variable:
    when value1:
        code to execute if variable is equal to value1
    when value2:
        code to execute if variable is equal to value2
    when value3:
        code to execute if variable is equal to value3
    otherwise:
        code to execute if variable is not equal to any of the specified values
```

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">To interpret code that makes use of selection, you need to understand how the IF, THEN, ELSE, ELSEIF, and CASE statements work and what conditions they are evaluating.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">To debug code that uses selection, you can use techniques such as adding print statements</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">to display the values of variables and the results of conditions, or using a debugger to step through the code line by line and see how the conditions are evaluated and the code is executed.</mark>

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.4.4 - Be able to write, interpret and debug code that makes use of iteration</mark>
To write algorithms that make use of programming constructs such as <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">sequence</mark>, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">selection</mark>, and <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">iteration</mark>, you need to understand the basic principles of these constructs and how they can be used to control the flow of a program.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Sequence is the most basic control flow construct, and refers to the order in which instructions in a program are executed.</mark> In most programming languages, instructions are executed in the order in which they are written, from top to bottom. To make use of sequence in your algorithms, you simply need to write your instructions in the order in which they should be executed.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Selection, also known as branching, allows a program to choose which instructions to execute based on a certain condition. In most programming languages, this is done using an if</mark> statement, which checks a condition and only executes the instructions within the `if` block if the condition is true. To make use of selection in your algorithms, you need to write `if` statements that check for the appropriate conditions and execute the correct instructions based on the results of those checks.

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Iteration, also known as looping, allows a program to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. In most programming languages, this is done using a while or for loop</mark>, which specifies a condition that determines when the loop should continue and a set of instructions that should be executed on each iteration of the loop. To make use of iteration in your algorithms, you need to write `while` or `for` loops that repeat the appropriate instructions for the desired number of iterations.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Overall, by understanding and making use of these programming constructs, you can write algorithms that are more powerful and efficient</mark>. By <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">carefully considering the sequence, selection, and iteration in your algorithms, you can ensure that your programs are able to perform the desired operations and make the necessary decisions.</mark>

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.4.5 - Be able to declare and call functions and procedures</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In most programming languages, you can declare and call functions and procedures using the following syntax:</mark>

To <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">declare a function</mark>:
```python
function name(parameters):
	# code to be executed     
	return result 
```

To <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">call a function</mark>:
```python
result = name(arguments)
```

To <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">declare a procedure</mark>:
```python
procedure name(parameters): 
	# code to be executed
```

To <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">call a procedure</mark>:
```python
name(arguments)
```

In the above examples, `name` is the name of the function or procedure, `parameters` is a list of parameters that the function or procedure takes as input, `arguments` is a list of arguments that is passed to the function or procedure when it is called, `code to be executed` is the code that the function or procedure will execute, and `result` is the value that the function will return when it is called.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In some programming languages, the syntax for declaring and calling functions and procedures may be slightly different. For example, in Python, you would use the def keyword to declare a function and the return keyword to return a value</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In Python, procedures are called "functions" as well, and they are declared and called in the same way as functions that return a value.</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">However, if a function does not return a value, it is considered a procedure.</mark>

##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.4.6 - Understand how standard searching and sorting algorithms work, and the benefits and drawbacks of each</mark>

<mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">PRO</mark> / <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">CON</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Linear search</mark> is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">simple searching algorithm that involves checking every element in a list until the desired element is found</mark>. <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">The pros of linear search are that it is simple to implement and it can be used with any data type. </mark><mark style="background: #D71414A6;">The cons of linear search are that it is not very efficient, especially for large lists, and it may not be the best choice for searching sorted lists.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Binary search</mark> is a more <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">efficient searching algorithm that involves dividing a list in half and searching for the desired element in one of the halves</mark>. The <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">pros of binary search are that it is much more efficient than linear search, especially for large lists, and it is particularly well-suited for searching sorted lists. </mark><mark style="background: #D71414A6;">The cons of binary search are that it requires the list to be sorted, and it can be more complex to implement than linear search.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Bubble sort</mark> is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">simple sorting algorithm that involves repeatedly swapping adjacent elements in a list if they are out of order</mark>. <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">The pros of bubble sort are that it is simple to implement and it can be used with any data type.</mark> <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">The cons of bubble sort are that it is not very efficient, especially for large lists, and it can be slow compared to other sorting algorithms.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Insertion sort</mark> is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sorting algorithm that involves building up a sorted list one element at a time.</mark> The<mark style="background: #14D71DA6;"> pros of insertion sort are that it is simple to implement and it can be efficient for small lists or lists that are already partially sorted.</mark> <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">The cons of insertion sort are that it is not very efficient for large lists, and it may not be the best choice for sorting unordered lists.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Merge sort</mark> is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sorting algorithm that involves dividing a list into smaller sublists, sorting the sublists, and then merging the sublists back together to create a fully-sorted list.</mark> The <mark style="background: #14D71DA6;">pros of merge sort are that it is efficient for large lists and it is a stable sorting algorithm,</mark> which means that it preserves the relative order of elements with the same value. The <mark style="background: #D71414A6;">cons of merge sort are that it can be complex to implement and it requires additional memory to store the sublists.</mark>
