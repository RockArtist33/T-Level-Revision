##### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.6.1 - Understand the need for different types of input validation and be able to write, interpret and debug code that makes use of these validation techniques</mark>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Presence check**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A presence check makes sure that a critical field cannot be left blank</mark>, it must be filled in. If someone tries to leave the field blank then an error message will appear and you won't be able to progress to another record or save any other data which you have entered.
- **Length check** 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Checks the length on an input</mark>, an example is passwords, making sure a password is greater than 10 
- **Type check** 	
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A type check will ensure that the correct type of data is entered into that field</mark>. For example, in a clothes shop, dress sizes may range from 8 to 18.  A number data type would be a suitable choice for this data.  By setting the data type as number, only numbers could be entered e.g. 10, 12, 14 and you would prevent anyone trying to enter text such as ‘ten’ or ‘ten and a half’.
- **Format check** 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A format check is a process of reviewing the formatting of a document or file to ensure that it adheres to a set of guidelines or specifications.</mark> This can include checking for things like font type and size, margins, indentations, and other visual elements. Format checks are often done to ensure that a document is easy to read and looks professional. They can also help to ensure consistency within a document or across multiple documents. Format checks can be done manually or using specialized software.
- **Range check** 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A range check allows you to set suitable boundaries,</mark> A range check is commonly used when you are working with data which consists of numbers, currency or dates/times.
- **Check digit.**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">This is used when you want to be sure that a range of numbers has been entered correctly.</mark> There are many different schemes (algorithms) for creating check digits.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.6.2 - Understand the need to develop reliable and robust code.</mark>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are several reasons why it is important to develop reliable and robust code. First, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reliable and robust code is essential for ensuring the correct functioning of software</mark> or other systems. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If code is not reliable and robust, it may contain errors or bugs that can cause the system to fail or behave unpredictably. This can lead to loss of data, reduced productivity, and other problems.</mark>

Second, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reliable and robust code is critical for maintaining the security of a system</mark>. If code is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not reliable and robust, it may be more susceptible to security vulnerabilities or attacks.</mark> This <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can put sensitive information or data at risk, and may result in financial losses or damage to a company's reputation.</mark>

Third, reliable and robust code is important for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">maintaining the integrity and quality of a system.</mark> If code is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not reliable and robust, it may not be able to handle unexpected inputs or changes in conditions, which can lead to poor performance or user experience</mark>. This <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can make a system less effective or appealing to users, and can affect its success and adoption.</mark>

Overall, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">developing reliable and robust code is essential for ensuring the correct functioning, security, and quality of a system</mark>. By <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">investing in reliable and robust code, companies and developers can build systems that are more effective, secure, and successful.</mark>
