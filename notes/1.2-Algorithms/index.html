A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm or process. It consists of a set of symbols and connectors, which show the steps of the algorithm and the relationships between them. <mark style=background:#d2b3ffa6>Flowcharts are often used to visualize and document the logic of a program or system, and to communicate algorithms to other people</mark>. They can also be useful for understanding and debugging code. Flowcharts are typically created using specialized software, and can be modified and updated as needed.</p><p><strong><mark style=background:#adccffa6>what are pseudocodes?</mark></strong>
high level description of a computer program or algorithm(sketching the code)written in symbolic code which must be translated into a programming language before it can be executed</p><ul><li><p><mark style=background:#d2b3ffa6>The main advantage of using flowcharts</mark> to express algorithms is that they provide a visual representation of the steps and decision points involved in the algorithm. This can make it easier to understand and communicate the algorithm to others, and can also help to identify potential errors or problems. Flowcharts can also be useful for debugging code, as they provide a high-level overview of the logic of the program.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#d2b3ffa6>One disadvantage of using flowcharts</mark> is that they can be time-consuming to create and update. They also require the use of specialized software, which can be difficult to learn and use. In addition, flowcharts can become complex and difficult to read when representing algorithms with many steps or decision points.</p></li></ul><p><mark style=background:#adccffa6>Pseudocode has some similar advantages to flowcharts,</mark> in that it provides a high-level, structured representation of an algorithm that is easy to understand and communicate. It is also often easier and faster to create and update than a flowchart. <mark style=background:#adccffa6>However, pseudocode is not a programming language, so it cannot be directly executed by a computer.</mark> This means that it must be translated into a programming language before it can be used to solve a problem. In addition, pseudocode can be difficult to read and understand if it is not written in a clear and consistent manner.</p><p><strong><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>How to use and Express them</mark></strong>
<mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>To express an algorithm using flowcharts, you would start by identifying the steps involved in the algorithm, and then representing each step as a symbol or shape on the flowchart.</mark> <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>These symbols and shapes are connected by arrows, which show the order in which the steps are performed.</mark> For example, a rectangular shape might represent a process or action, while a diamond shape might represent a decision point.</p><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>To express an algorithm using pseudocode, you would write out the steps of the algorithm in a natural language-like syntax that is easy to read and understand</mark>. <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Pseudocode is not a programming language, but rather a way of expressing algorithms in a high-level, structured way that is similar to a programming language</mark>. For example, you might use statements like &ldquo;if x is greater than y, then do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;while z is not equal to 0, do that&rdquo;.</p><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>When planning a digital solution, flowcharts and pseudocode can be useful tools for understanding and communicating the algorithms that will be used to solve a problem.</mark> They can help you organize and clarify your thoughts, and make it easier to spot potential errors or problems. They can also help you to think through the different steps and decisions involved in the algorithm, and to determine the best way to implement it in a digital solution.</p><a href=#mark-stylebackground-bbfabba6123---be-able-to-write-algorithms-that-make-use-of-programming-constructs-sequence-selection-iterationmark><h5 id=mark-stylebackground-bbfabba6123---be-able-to-write-algorithms-that-make-use-of-programming-constructs-sequence-selection-iterationmark><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><mark style=background:#bbfabba6>1.2.3 - Be able to write algorithms that make use of programming constructs (sequence, selection, iteration)</mark></h5></a><ul><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Sequence</mark> refers to <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>the order in which instructions are executed in a program.</mark> In most programming languages, instructions are executed in the order in which they appear in the code, from top to bottom and left to right. This allows you to specify a series of steps that the program should follow to solve a problem.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Selection</mark>, also known as <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>branching</mark>, <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>refers to the ability of a program to make decisions based on certain conditions.</mark> For example, you might use an if-then statement to specify that a certain action should only be performed if a certain condition is true. This allows you to create programs that can adapt to different inputs and scenarios.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Iteration</mark>, also known as <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>looping</mark>, <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>refers to the ability of a program to repeat a sequence of instructions until a certain condition is met. For example, you might use a while loop to repeat a set of instructions until a certain value is reached</mark>. This allows you to create programs that can perform the same actions on multiple pieces of data, or that can repeat an operation until a certain result is achieved.</p></li><li><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Together, these concepts form the building blocks of most programming languages, and are essential for creating effective and efficient algorithms.</mark></p></li></ul><a href=#mark-stylebackground-bbfabba6124---understand-the-purpose-of-a-given-algorithm-flowcharts-written-descriptions-pseudocode-program-code-and-how-the-algorithm-worksmark><h5 id=mark-stylebackground-bbfabba6124---understand-the-purpose-of-a-given-algorithm-flowcharts-written-descriptions-pseudocode-program-code-and-how-the-algorithm-worksmark><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><mark style=background:#bbfabba6>1.2.4 - Understand the purpose of a given algorithm (flowcharts, written descriptions, pseudocode, program code) and how the algorithm works.</mark></h5></a><ul><li><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>Flowcharts</mark><ul><li>Flowcharts are graphical representations of an algorithm that show the steps and the decision points involved in the solution of a problem.
