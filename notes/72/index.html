The topology of a network can affect its performance, reliability, and scalability, and there are several different types of topologies that are used in different situations.</mark></p><p>One important concept in network topologies is the <mark style=background:#d2b3ffa6>distinction between logical and physical topologies</mark>. The <mark style=background:#d2b3ffa6>logical topology refers to the way in which data is transmitted and routed within a network, regardless of the physical arrangement of the devices.</mark> <mark style=background:#d2b3ffa6>The physical topology, on the other hand, refers to the actual layout and arrangement of the devices within the network.</mark></p><p>One common type of network topology is the <mark style=background:#abf7f7a6>star topology</mark>, in which<mark style=background:#abf7f7a6> all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. This topology is easy to set up and manage, and it allows for easy expansion by adding new devices to the network.</mark> However, it can be vulnerable to failure if the central hub or switch goes down.</p><p>Another common type of network topology is the <mark style=background:#adccffa6>mesh topology, in which all devices are connected to each other directly</mark>. This <mark style=background:#adccffa6>topology provides multiple paths for data to travel, which can improve reliability and fault tolerance</mark>. However, it can be more complex to set up and manage, and it can require a large number of connections.</p><p>The <mark style=background:#ffb86ca6>tree topology</mark> is a <mark style=background:#ffb86ca6>variation of the star and mesh topologies, in which the network is organized into a hierarchy of devices. This topology allows for the creation of multiple sub-networks, which can be useful in large, complex networks.</mark> However, it can also be vulnerable to failure if a higher-level device goes down.</p><p>A VLAN <mark style=background:#ff5582a6>(Virtual Local Area Network)</mark> is a l<mark style=background:#ff5582a6>ogical topology that is used to create multiple virtual networks on a single physical network.</mark> <mark style=background:#ff5582a6>VLANs can be used to segment a network into different groups or departments, which can improve security and network performance.</mark> However, they can also be complex to set up and manage, and they require special VLAN-aware devices and infrastructure.</p><a href=#mark-stylebackground-bbfabba6728---understand-the-role-and-characteristics-of-common-components-of-a-networkmark><h5 id=mark-stylebackground-bbfabba6728---understand-the-role-and-characteristics-of-common-components-of-a-networkmark><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><mark style=background:#bbfabba6>7.2.8 - Understand the role and characteristics of common components of a network</mark></h5></a><p><mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>A network is a system of devices that are connected together to allow for the exchange of data and information.</mark> There are <mark style=background:#fff3a3a6>several different components that are commonly used in networks, each of which has its own role and characteristics.</mark></p><p>A <mark style=background:#ff5582a6>server</mark> is a <mark style=background:#ff5582a6>powerful computer that is responsible for providing services to other devices on the network</mark>.

A router receives data from a source device, determines the best path to the destination device, and forwards the data to the destination. Routers use routing protocols and algorithms to make decisions about how to route data, and they can also provide security and network management functions.</p><p>A <mark style=background:#abf7f7a6>network switch</mark> is a device that is <mark style=background:#abf7f7a6>responsible for connecting multiple devices on a network</mark>. A switch receives data from a source device, identifies the destination device, and forwards the data to the destination. Switches can operate at different layers of the network, and they can provide a range of features, such as security, quality of service, and virtual LAN support.</p><p>A <mark style=background:#adccffa6>client</mark> is a <mark style=background:#adccffa6>device that is used to access services and resources provided by servers on the network</mark>. A client can be any type of device, such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet, and it connects to the network to request services from servers.
